# 🌟 About
This project utilizes **Java Spring Boot** and **AngularJS** to create a web application for computational numeric calculations. 🚀

## 📖 Read in Portuguese
For Portuguese documentation, see [README.pt.md](README.pt.md).

## 🛠️ Necessary Tools
- **Java 17** ☕
- **Java IDE** (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse) 💻
- **Node.js** (for Angular) 🌐
- **Angular CLI** ⚙️

## 📚 Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
First, clone this repository to your local machine:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/PedroFurigo/Computational-Numeric-Calculation.git
```

### 2.Set Up the Backend (Java Spring Boot)
Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd computationalnumericcalculation/main
```

Make sure Java 17 is installed. You can check by running:

```bash
java -version
```

Open the project in your Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA).

correct path to directory for springBootAplication "backend/src/main/java/com/unip/computationalnumericcalculation/ComputationalnumericcalculationApplication.java"

Run the Spring Boot application. You can do this by right-clicking on the main class (with the @SpringBootApplication annotation) and selecting "Run".

The backend should be running at http://localhost:8080.

### 3. Set Up the Frontend (Angular)
Open a terminal and navigate to the frontend directory:

```bash
cd seu-repositorio/frontend
```
Make sure Node.js and Angular CLI are installed. Check by running:

```bash
node -v
ng version
```

Install the project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```
Start the Angular development server:

```bash
ng serve
```
Access the application in your browser at http://localhost:4200. 🌍

### 4. How to Use
After setting up and running the backend and frontend, you can use the application to perform computational numeric calculations directly in the interface. 🧮
